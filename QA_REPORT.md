### Non-blocking optimization opportunities

Based on the Mobile Lighthouse audit, the following optional polish items were identified. These are **not launch blockers** and can be addressed in future iterations:

| Opportunity | Est. Savings | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Eliminate render-blocking resources | ~1300 ms | Low |
| Improve caching policy | ~906 KiB | Low |
| Optimize image delivery (next-gen formats) | ~223 KiB | Low |
| Reduce unused JavaScript | ~29 KiB | Low |
| Investigate 1 long task on main thread | TBD | Low |

These represent ~2.5 seconds of potential optimization and ~1.2 MiB of payload reduction, but are not critical for launch readiness.
